# Disparate

TL;DR - react + portals + redux 

## Why?

Still here? Well in some cases one may need to intermingle the awesome reactness with a monolithically rendered framework. Website, ecommerce store etc. 
For instance you may wish to swap out the on page cart in an eccomerce store, at the same time as you may wish to handle personalisations with a react app, possibly a custom form as another. 

These apps are disparte in nature, but share some theoretical common ground.

disparate is just a starting point to maintain these without creating refactor hell over a set of apps, structures and approaches. It is opinionated int he fact that it uses redux but you could swap this out if you feel that the app dosnt warrant the approach. If that is the case, this probably isnt the package for you.
